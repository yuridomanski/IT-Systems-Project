### Apple Security Shock As Mac Threats Outpace Microsoft Windows By 2 To 1

https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/02/11/platform-wars-2020-apple-security-threats-outpace-microsoft-windows-for-first-time/#11f63c517c5a

My first experience of technology platform wars was back in 1985 when the protagonists were Amiga and Atari. I was an Amiga person and went on to write about the platform for many publications in the next decade. There have been many such battles of the brand since, but none has had the longevity of Apple Vs. Microsoft. Or, more precisely, Macs against Windows machines. A newly published report into the state of malware, however, threatens to expose a new dimension to the old debate: cybersecurity threat wars. The Malwarebytes research uses data from product telemetry, honeypots, and assorted threat intelligence metrics to analyze the threats to both consumers and businesses across 2019. One of the more interesting trends to be identified concerns the platform-specific nature of cybersecurity threats. Mac threats, the report reveals, increased exponentially in comparison to Windows ones. I'll let that sink in for a moment. 

A deep dive into the Mac malware waters

The 2020 Malwarebytes "State of Malware Report," took a deep dive into the real-world threats that faced Android and iOS users, browser-based attacks and both Mac and Windows PCs. Having crunched the numbers and analyzed the data, the report concludes that the volume of Mac threats increased by more than 400% year-on-year in 2019, outpacing Windows "threats per endpoint" by a ratio of nearly two to one. That latter number being the more important as it allows for the fact that Malwarebytes has a larger Mac userbase than Windows.

Digging deeper into the threats themselves, the report suggests that only one of the Mac threats in 2019 didn't involve tricking the user into downloading and executing something malicious. That incident was when cryptocurrency companies, including Coinbase, were targeted using a Firefox zero-day vulnerability as the malware infection vector. "This was the first time such a vulnerability had been used to infect Macs in any significant way since 2012," the researchers said, "when Java vulnerabilities were used repeatedly to infect Macs." Most of the Mac threats, it would appear, were of the adware variety and found to be "far outpacing growth on the Windows side." Sure, adware isn't as great a threat as ransomware, which has continued to impact Windows systems across 2019, but it does still display "malicious and persistent behaviors to trick users into a false sense of security."

The report goes on to reveal that more front and center malicious behavior from Mac files is also increasing year-over-year, employing ever more inventive and deceptive approaches to escape Apple detection. Malware "breakthroughs" impacting iOS, the report said, "may have the tech behemoth reconsidering whether they should allow anti-virus products on their beloved mobile devices."

Is it time to get serious about Mac security?

Taking a cursory look at my own media coverage here, I have reported on far more Windows threat stories than Mac ones. Everything from state-sponsored campaigns through to critical vulnerabilities in browsers for Windows users and numerous critical security alerts as well as advice on securing Windows 10.

This doesn't mean that Apple has escaped scrutiny, just that there are fewer security incidents of note to report. The odd iPhone-specific piece of malware, and even a Siri 'feature' that left Apple Mail encrypted text unencrypted. Mostly, though, when I've written about Apple from the security perspective it has been to offer advice on securing an Apple Watch 5, or looking at apps that know if your iPhone has been hacked.

The Malwarebytes researchers, however, concluded that what the 2019 threat landscape tells us as we move further into 2020, is that "it’s time to take a good hard look at Mac security and finally get serious." A rise in pre-installed malware, adware, and multi-vector attacks signals that threat actors are becoming more creative and increasingly persistent with their campaigns," Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of Malwarebytes, said, "it is imperative that, as an industry, we continue to raise the bar in defending against these sophisticated attacks."

So, what does the infosecurity industry make of this analysis and the broader concept of cybersecurity platform wars? I thought I'd ask and find out.

Is there any place for platform wars in your cybersecurity strategy?

"Cybereason is seeing a noticeable increase in malware strains and threat groups that are targeting Mac systems," says Israel Barak, CISO at Cybereason, "we are also seeing a steady increase in the level of sophistication in the tools being used to target Mac systems and in particular, the use of built-in operating system capabilities (living-off-the-land) to better evade detection." Tim Erlin, vice-president of product management and strategy at Tripwire, isn't convinced that, as a standalone statistic, it matters whether Mac or Windows malware is the more prevalent. "The prevalence of malware for a particular platform is really a reflection of the target environment," Erlin says, what is important is to "ask the follow-up questions of why the focus of malware authors may have changed, or how changes in malware trends impact defensive priorities."

Oliver Pinson-Roxburgh, the co-founder of Bulletproof, says that "the larger population of corporate laptops are Windows-based, and they provide the greatest opportunity, which is why we see more malware for Windows systems specifically." Of course, as the Malwarebytes analysis suggests, the balance can shift as a different OS gains market share, or more lucrative vulnerabilities appear. Pinson-Roxburgh points out that "we only know about the vulnerabilities and malware that the more targeted hackers want us to know about, why leak that you have a Mac Zero-Day if you can keep it hidden and benefit from it?" Then there's the small matter of misplaced trust. "Unfortunately, there are a lot of Mac users out there entirely trusting the fact that macOS architecture and the higher amount of Windows PCs connected to the internet, will prevent bad actors from targeting them," Felix Rosbach, product manager at comforte AG, says. "It is absolutely crucial to implement cybersecurity countermeasures on both platforms," Rosbach concludes, "independent of any malware statistics."

Martin Jartelius, CSO at Outpost24, says that the malware platform matters less than the factors behind such growth trends. "If we, for example, make the assumption that this is due to a technical difference," Jartelius says, "it may drive decisions for risk mitigation. If we assume it’s due to the degree of commercial adoption of one platform over the other, we may not be able to make the same conclusions." It's a pointless discussion, Jartelius tells me, "you will need awareness, hardening, patching and anti-virus software regardless of the chosen platform." It all depends, says Tom Hegel, a security researcher at AT&T Cybersecurity's Alien Labs, on your threat modeling. "The number of threats may not really matter to an organization which is highly targeted by capable attackers," Hegel says, "however, an individual's personal device may have a higher chance of being infected with something by using the devices with a wider variety of threats."

Cybercriminals could care less what platform you use

David Jemmett, CEO of Cerberus Sentinel, says that people are under a delusion about the Mac malware threat being less than Windows. "You must first understand that Mac is built on a UNIX platform with a GUI interface," Jemmett says, "seasoned hackers have been penetrating or taking over UNIX systems since the beginning of ARPANET." Jemmett agrees with the premise that cybercriminals don't care what OS, machine or type of connection you have to the internet. "They only care if they can extract money from the source of an attack," he says, "Mac users as a whole have heard the myth they are safer with Mac than a Windows PC. Those statements are false and should be stricken from anyone’s thoughts and taken out of everyone’s vocabulary."

"From the perspective of a defender within an organization," Javvad Malik, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, says, "it is usually good to have information about the latest malware and the operating systems it targets." Historically, this has meant Windows malware has been more prevalent because of OS market domination. "But now with more Macs making their way into organizations, there are going to be more Mac-focused attacks," Malik says. However, in the broader scheme of things, does this matter when many organizations, for example, have adopted cloud to some extent? "We see attacks such as credential stuffing to gain access to corporate accounts, which are operating system agnostic," Malik says, "in the large scheme of things, it really doesn't matter all that much which operating system malware is increasing on if we still can't prevent the basic steps of intruders getting in."

Cybercriminals follow value not statistics

Jonathan Knudsen, a senior security strategist at Synopsys, uses the analogy of choosing somewhere to live to explain how cybercriminals follow value. "At first glance, you might choose an apartment building with a low incidence of crime," Knudsen says, "however, as more people move to the building, its value as a target for crime increases. In the short term, you might reduce risk by following statistics, but you still need to take appropriate steps to keep yourself safe and your belongings secure." Statistics and metrics about Windows Vs. Mac malware are, perhaps, interesting to look at in their own right, according to Michael Barragry, the operations lead at edgescan, "but have perhaps become less relevant as both organizations have matured and both are deeply embedded throughout global organizations, so offer high-value targets for malware and similar attacks."

I will leave the last, self-admittedly obtuse, word to Chris Clements, vice-president of solutions architecture at Cerberus Security. "You and a friend are walking down the street with different colored shirts on," Clements says. One hundred feet ahead, two attackers step out and aim a gun at each of you. The attacker targeting you (macOS) is using a revolver, the attacker targeting your friend (Windows) has a fully automatic M16. "Just because you are less likely to get shot doesn’t make you any less dead if you are..."

### macOS vs. Windows: Which OS Really Is the Best?

https://au.pcmag.com/operating-systems-1/59632/macos-vs-windows-which-os-really-is-the-best

I dread the disgruntled comments, emails, and tweets headed my way because of this comparison, but hear me out. People on both sides of the OS war probably just aren’t aware of what the other side has to offer, and some of them may be curious about it.

In the spirit of full disclosure, like more than 80 percent of the desktop and laptop world, I am primarily a Windows user. I am, however, an iPhone devotee, and as a software reviewer, I have lots of experience on Macs. I’m not a Mac or Apple hater by a long shot.

Rather than just framing this as an argument for one side or another, I’ll simply work my way through the standard operating system features, comparing Microsoft and Apple’s offerings along the way. Yes, each category will have a winner, and we’ll tally the points up in the end, but your choice of OS involves much more than just features, hardware and software support, and capabilities. It involves what the people around you use, your ecosystem (including your smartphone and tablet), your business needs, and your personality.

Feel free to add your thoughts in the comment section at the end of this article, whether you're a Windows or a macOS fan. Let us know why you're in your particular camp.

Security and Stability

This one is another no-brainer. Windows PCs have fallen prey to far more malware than Macs in the recent past, including ransomware, spyware, botnets, and good old-fashioned viruses. But Microsoft is constantly beefing up its security, pushing Windows Defender updates, and even introducing anti-ransomware measures.

Macs have a much cleaner record, but they’re by no means immune to vulnerabilities. Just look at the recent Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, which affect both operating systems. Our security guru, Neil Rubenking, strongly recommends using antivirus software on Macs.

Both operating systems offer built-in VPN support, and all of PCMag's top VPN service choices are available on both platforms, so that category is a wash.

And then there’s the issue of stability. Macs win on this count, too, mostly because Apple controls the hardware ecosystem (third-party drivers are a major cause of instability on Windows PCs). We’ve even seen blue screens on Microsoft’s own Surface computers. Those looking for the ultimate in stability, though, should check out Linux.

Winner: macOS

### Is Mac really more secure than Windows? We asked the experts 

https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/privacy-macos-or-windows-we-asked-the-experts/

Apple talks a big game when it comes to security. Its stance on user privacy has been one of the dominant themes of Apple’s marketing, especially in the past few years. In a world awash with data leaks and cybercriminals, that’s reassuring.

But when it comes to the Mac and its comparisons against Windows, are the assumptions true? Is MacOS actually better at protecting your privacy? After all, a recent survey found that more Americans trust Microsoft than Apple with their private data, at a rate of 75% to 69%. Could it be correct?

We decided to ask the experts, from tech analysts and privacy advocates to antivirus specialists. We also went to Microsoft and Apple themselves to find out what their desktop operating systems do to keep your data safe. Here’s what we found out.

Does MacOS go far enough?

MacOS and Windows are both desktop operating systems, but they have different philosophies when it comes to security and privacy. MacOS is for Macs only. Windows 10, on the other hand, runs on hardware from dozens of manufacturers, all offering different systems and configurations. The assumption is that Apple’s closed system has a positive impact on security and privacy.

To find out how much truth is in that assumption, we spoke to Ray Walsh of the advocacy group ProPrivacy. The organization conducts research and reviews from purely a privacy standpoint.

“Apple can be credited with an advantage due to its tighter control over the hardware that runs MacOS,” Walsh told Digital Trends. “This does make MacOS more secure, which improves data privacy by decreasing the chances of hardware-based vulnerabilities that lead to hacking or surveillance.”

So far, so good. However, Walsh does sound a word of caution: “Despite a popular perception that Apple is a security and privacy-conscious developer, the reality is that MacOS is a closed source platform,” he said. “This means that Mac users are ultimately at the whim of the tech giant, and it is hard to state with any confidence exactly what kind of telemetry Apple might (or might not) be acquiring via its operating system.”

Walsh has a point. A closed system means the public doesn’t always have a great idea of what Apple is actually doing to prove its promises. This tight control is exasperating because Apple could do more with it to keep your data truly private. Walsh notes that Apple shares personal data with fewer third-party companies, which allows Tim Cook to make some bold claims about its user privacy stances. But for Walsh, being better than the competition isn’t good enough.

“Many firms profit from data by turning it into a direct revenue stream, selling consumer data to any third party that is willing to pay,” he said. “Apple does this less than some of its biggest competitors. However, it does still allow app developers to collect data from users directly.”

In other words, if it’s going to hold tighter reins on its devices, it should also be held to a higher standard for privacy and security. Walsh notes that Apple is still collecting a lot of data from users. It still allows apps within the App Store to harvest sensitive information, in some cases, even as they sleep.

“This is frustrating because Apple has more control over its platform than any other manufacturer, and it could set much tighter restrictions on app developers to improve privacy for its users. The ugly reality is that, despite all the talk, it is not opting to do those things.”

Privacy remains an opt-in choice for Windows 10

Ray Walsh may have been critical of Mac, but when it came to Windows, he held no punches.

“Windows 10 is recognized by privacy experts as being invasive due to the widespread collection of telemetry data that is enabled by default,” he told us. “The tracking performed is comprehensive and includes things like your search history in Bing, your browsing history and a transcript of the things you say to Cortana, your location history, and health data acquired via HealthVault and Microsoft Band.”

In the early days of Windows 10, it was roundly criticized for the amount of data it collected by default. Microsoft quickly made changes, but even these weren’t enough to placate regulatory bodies like the European Union. Five years on from the launch, is Windows 10 any better at keeping your data private?

Walsh still thinks Windows 10 collects too much telemetry data, even with all its privacy settings enabled. “Gaining total privacy when using Windows 10 is ultimately impossible,” as he put it. Most of the experts we interviewed agreed with Walsh, but Microsoft says it’s taken big steps toward transparency and privacy controls.

We spoke to Marisa Rogers, Privacy Officer of Windows, Browsers, & Devices at Microsoft, to see what she says the Redmond giant does for your privacy.

“We have been sharing our Windows privacy journey for the last several years as we addressed concerns from customers and the marketplace,” she explained. “Most recently we announced plans to increase transparency and control for our customers by categorizing all data we collect as either required or optional for all our major products.”

Rogers says Microsoft categorizes some data as “required” for sharing, such as basic diagnostics. This kind of user data is used to keep Windows up-to-date and working properly, as well as aiding the delivery of the latest security updates. Information like what device people are using Windows on falls into this category. This can’t be turned off, regardless of the settings you choose.

It’s the data that falls into the “optional” category that Windows lets you control.

“Data in the optional category (such as Full diagnostic data), like how the specific apps in use when an error occurs or data about a download start/finish to address download issues, helps us provide a better experience to customers,” Rogers told us. “Users can change their privacy settings with regard to optional data collection at any time.”

Sounds fair, right? Well, not so fast. Ryan O’Leary, a Senior Research Analyst at IDC, told us there’s a catch in opt-in data collection.

“Windows certainly gives their users the ability to make choice around what they are providing to Microsoft,” said O’Leary, who specializes in the legal side of tech, including risk management and regulation. “However, we have seen in the EU the concept of privacy by default. Microsoft allows a significant level of customization but to my knowledge that is all opt-in by the user. It creates headwinds for unsophisticated users who aren’t hyper-focused on privacy to enforce their privacy when it should be the default choice.”

There’s little transparency about where this data goes or how exactly it is used. There’s a reason regulatory bodies are moving toward privacy by default: Few people spend the time to dig into their privacy controls. Even if Microsoft isn’t doing anything nefarious with the data, it gets into trouble leaving so many privacy concerns turned on by default.

As it turns out, there’s a better alternative.

Making use of differential privacy

Is MacOS any better in this regard? When we spoke to people at Apple, they told us that the company’s Mac privacy stance is built on five pillars: Data minimization, on-device processing, transparency and control, protecting a user’s identity, and data security.

Of those pillars, one of the most important for privacy is on-device processing. If your Mac can do everything you need it to without sending your data to a third-party server, the chances of someone intercepting that data or hacking the server are greatly reduced.

This is one area where Ray Walsh says Apple is doing well. “If and when Apple does encrypt data and store it locally — so that it is never accessible to Apple or the third parties it works with — this is without a doubt a win for digital privacy on the platform.”

When your Mac does send your data to Apple’s servers, Apple often takes steps to keep that data private. In MacOS, your Siri requests are sent to Apple, but are given a random identifier instead of your Apple ID so they can’t be tied back to you. In Windows, if you’ve signed in to a Microsoft account then your Cortana requests will be sent to Microsoft along with your account details.

Another expert we consulted for this piece was Thomas Reed, Director of Mac & Mobile at Malwarebytes. We’ve spoken to him before when we investigated whether Macs need antivirus software. What does he think of the privacy provisions in MacOS?

“When it comes to Apple, I’d have to say they set a very high bar on privacy,” he explained. “Folks love to hate on Apple and like to say that privacy is just a PR claim for Apple every time they have a privacy stumble. However, from my observations of Apple over the years, my perception is that Apple is taking privacy extremely seriously.”

Reed claimed that Apple has done things for the sake of privacy that could have been compromised in the name of saving money or improving the user experience. One example is Apple Maps. The app has long been criticized for being inferior to Google Maps, but Reed inferred that it was Apple’s stringent privacy stance that held it back.

“For example, for years Maps was inferior because Apple didn’t want to collect user data, and when they did finally start collecting data, they did it in such a way that it should not be possible to identify specific users. They broke up the data into little bits, so they can see general traffic patterns, but can’t see that any user went from point A to point B.”

This is known as “differential privacy.” As Reed notes, it gives Maps a privacy advantage. “[This is] unlike other maps, where data is anonymized but easy to deanonymize by simply looking at the routes taken by a specific ‘anonymized’ user.”

As Reed noted, this is something the average user would never know if Apple didn’t market it.

Mac really is more secure

So, what’s the final verdict? Which desktop operating system is best for your privacy, Windows or MacOS?

The consensus seems to be with Apple. Pieter Arntz, Thomas Reed’s colleague and Lead Intelligence Reporter at Malwarebytes, put it this way. “Windows privacy has improved going from Windows 7 and 8 to 10, but it’s far from the level Apple is providing.”

Walsh, meanwhile, stated that while the survey placing Microsoft ahead of Apple in terms of trust was interesting, “this popular perception is generally incorrect and there is little reason to trust Microsoft over Apple.”

Still, the extent to which MacOS is best depends on who you ask. Many of the experts we spoke to felt that while Apple wasn’t perfect in this regard, it was doing more than most.

Here’s what Ryan O’Leary had to say about it. “We are entering an era where trusted enterprises will separate themselves from the pack. IDC views trust in five pillars: Security, Risk, Compliance, Privacy, and Ethics & Social Responsibility. Enterprises need to invest in those five things to foster trust within their enterprise. Privacy currently is an extremely low bar for doing more than the minimum and Apple is one of the few enterprises currently selling their company based on privacy. So, while those features may not be the most private way to conduct business, they are doing more than many of their peers.”

There were other experts, such as Ray Walsh, who cautioned that, while MacOS had taken some positive steps regarding privacy, users still must trust that Apple is true to its word in its privacy promises. “Both Microsoft and Apple Mac could do more to provide privacy for their users,” he explained. “It is important to remember that true privacy would be to disable tracking and data harvesting data altogether. This is possible, but it is not in the best interest of those platforms to do this because of the vast revenue sums they can generate by doing the opposite.”

Neither company is doing enough to please cybersecurity experts. But with few alternatives, we’re still left having to decide between the two, and almost everyone agreed: Your data is likely safer and more private on MacOS than on Windows.

As Microsoft continues to make gains in this department and user sensitivity to the issue changes, the situation will continue to evolve. For now, the assumption about the Mac’s superior security stands.

### END
